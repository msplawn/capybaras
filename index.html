    <p>The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world.[2] Also called capivara (in Brazil), chigüire, chigüiro (in Colombia and Venezuela) and carpincho (in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), it is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus, of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the coypu. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species, but it is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3]</p>
    <p>Capybaras are able to stay underwater for five minutes, in order to hide themselves. It is the largest living rodent on Earth. Until 1969, they were also hunted in Brazil for their skin. Today, it is prohibited to hunt capybaras in Brazil, while in Venezuela its hunting is regulated.</p>
